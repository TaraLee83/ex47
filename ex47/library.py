	      Dragons did not ask for the terrible task of gaurding the souls.
	      They knew that ungaurded those souls and the riches the created
	      both in crude gold and in their combined ability to separate and
	      protect a realm from the rest of existence would soon attract dark
	      forces. Greed and the lust for realms to press beneath ones thumb

	      of gold dragons who brought the need to the Green dragons, who in
	      the 7th century of the current age ruled proudly. It is undoubtedly
	      because of this pride that they called for immediate relocation, they
	      themselves moved from the caverns of the forest, to the cold and
	      unwelcoming territory now called Dragonlands. When, in the next 
	      century, the alliance of The Red rose to overwhelm the the alliance
	      of The Green; in the bloody and savage manner that Dragons have;
	      they took the protectors mantle as their own. This ensured that 
	      no human would oppose the new powers and that they longstanding peace
	      between would remain, as their own interests were still kept. It
	      allowed The Green, having more pride than sense, to succede before
	      their numbers had dwindled to the post coup numbers of the fallen 
	      of the old age. Peace among their own was of great interest to The
	      Red, they did afterall seek to rule all. And more was a much more
