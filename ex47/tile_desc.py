	    three crooked lines of jagged rock outcropping that
	    the cruel and ceaseless winds had filed into spear-like
	    points. If the warm blue sky brought hope to this place,
	    The Smile tore it apart and consumed it with delight.

	    see a dozen round openings in the three rows of jagged

"To your West this drops abruptly into the ocean. To the East is the "

	     wildflowers and alive at the thicket with birds that 
	     shook leaf cluster as they hopped from one branch to 
	     another. Snakes bent the tall dry grasses, toads
	     and water fowl made wary gutterations as they worked to
	     silence the clicking, clacking, humming and buzzing of a 
	     host of insects around them. 
	        To your right you hear the water of Histears breaking
	     around the crystal columns that encase the bodies and souls
	     suspended there. Including Harper. The strikes the crystals
	     and within, light and energy depose each other with fervor,
	     as all movement leads to creation so does that between the
	     sun, the memory of the crystal, the malleability of the water
	     and the minerals leached from the soil. Thick as syrup, 
	     a wheaten gold, from beneath the clustered crystals flowed
	     a liquid that as it traveled from the warm waters near the 
	     sun drenched Western summits to the vast lake encircled by
	     the point between the Eastern and Western Summits known
	     as The Dragons Smile hardened into common gold.
