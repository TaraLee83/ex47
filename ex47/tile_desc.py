	    Northwest. It ended at the point between the Eastern and
	    Western summits known as The Dragons Smile. The Smile:
	    three crooked lines of jagged rock outcropping that
	    the cruel and ceaseless winds had filed into spear-like
	    points. If the warm blue sky brought hope to this place,
	    The Smile tore it apart and consumed it with delight.

	    see a dozen round openings in the three rows of jagged
	    rock. The caves were crudley smashed into the rockface.
	    Their entrances are all obscured by fires black.

	     shook leaf cluster as they hopped from one branch to 
	     another. Snakes bent the tall dry grasses, toads

	     silence the clicking, clacking, humming and buzzing of a 
	     host of insects around them. 
	        To your right you hear the water of Histears breaking
	     around the crystal columns that encase the bodies and souls

	     sun, the memory of the crystal, the malleability of the water
	     and the minerals leached from the soil. Thick as syrup, 
	     a wheaten gold, from beneath the clustered crystals flowed
	     a liquid that as it traveled from the warm waters near the 
	     sun drenched Western summits to the vast lake encircled by
	     the point between the Eastern and Western Summits known
