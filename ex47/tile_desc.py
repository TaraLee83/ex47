scene = {1: "The meadow breaks and drops to North and West, ringed and "
"buttressed by the jagged black rock drop into the sea. Here, where the "
"sea spray travels the winds and falls upon the grasses, no trees take "
"root. Only wheaten grasses grow in abundance, they sway under the gales "
"in ripples that make the North-West meadow seem a sea of its own.",
         2: "Clouds seldom trouble the skies so near to the meadows "
"farthest edge. Hundreds of feet above the crashing sea, this stretch of "
"land is clear of trees and home to crab grass and wild rose bushes."         ,
         3: "A fog hangs over the line of foothills that run from North "
"to South on the Eastern side. Prairie grass and wildflowers give way to thickening brush "
"and a scattering of willows with arms outreached. "         ,
         4: "A fog hangs over the line of foothills that run from North "
"to South on the Western side. The low hills climbed quickly to meet The "
"Smile. The Smile was three crooked lines of jagged rock outcropping that "
"began at the upsweep of the foothills that divided the Northeast from "
"the Northwest. It stretched the Northernmost sky to the foot of A Vumu. The cruel and "
"ceaseless winds had filed house-sized boulders into spear-like points. "
"If the warm blue sky brought hope to this place, The Smile tore it apart "
"and consumed it with delight.",
         5: "The waters of The Sorrow were icy as befitting its surroundings. "
"To the North, a dozen round openings in the three rows of jagged rock. The "
"caves had been crudley smashed into the rockface. Their entrances are all "
"obscured by char.To the East rose the volcano, A Vumu. To the South, water "
"trickled through the Soul Shards.",
         6: "A towering volcano churns. Spewing acidic fog out over "
"itself. Twisted, grey trees spot the middle of the volcano and the "
"base is thick with thorned brush and alive with the hissing of the "
"volcano lizards that thrived in the shadow of the sulfuric chimney "
"that kept a steady stream of avian meat falling their way.",
         7: "A strip of wind-swept meadow runs from South to North. "
"To your West this drops abruptly into the ocean. To the East is the "
"back of a hut-like dwelling. Vines cover the sunburned walls. The "
"plaster has fallen away in places to reveal cerulean blue brick. "
"Ivy covers the back wall. Through the window you hear humming. The "
"tune sounds faintly familiar. ",
         8: "The inside of her home is open and airy. Sunlight pours "
"through the windows. Vines hang outside the windows, heavy with bloom, "
"the rich sugar and lemon scent of which had soaked into the the faded "
"brown rough-spun wool covered seats and bed. In the back right corner "
"a black kettle half the size of a horse sat on an iron stand in the "
"open stove. The Stove itself comprised the corner where that joined the "
"Western and Northern walls. All of the shimmering black cliff rock that ",
         9: "A fog hangs over the line of foothills that run from North "
"to South. Prairie grass and wildflowers give way to thickening brush "
"and a scattering of willows with arms outreached.",
         10: "The Western summits flanked your left. Sun browned, "
"speckled with common yellow and blue-bell wildflowers and alive at "
"the thicket with birds that shook leaf cluster as they hopped from "
"one branch to another. Snakes bent the tall dry grasses, toads and "
"water fowl made wary gutterations as they worked to silence the "
"clicking, clacking, humming and buzzing of a host of insects around "
"them. To your right you heard the waters of The Sorrow breaking around "
"the crystal columns that encased the bodies and souls suspended there. " 
"Including Arturia. The sun struck the crystals. Within, light and "
"energy deposed each other fervently. All movement leads to creation. "
"There was movement in each of these and between them an elegant dance, "
"The sun, the memory and structure of the crystal, the malleability and "
"powers of transference of the water and the minerals leached from the "
"soil. Thick as syrup, a wheaten gold, from beneath the clustered "
"crystals flowed. Once around the crystals roots to warmer waters and "
"back down again, backwashed to empty into The Sorrow while the winters "
"snow pack melted steadily. The waters came to calm within the vast lake, "
"over its brow the join of Eastern and Western Summits known as The "
"Dragons Smile. Here in the bottom of The Sorrow that souls honey "
"hardened into common gold.",
         11: "You stand upon the ice encrusted string of rocks that make "
"an island of these crystal encased soul shards. The brilliance and beauty "
"threatens to overwhelm you. You wish all at once to weep, to fall to your "
"knees in thanks to the gods that your small soul could, in life, releive "
"your eyes with such beauty, to scream at the impossiblity of life at the "
"cruelty of existence to give humans such detailed comprehension at the "
"deformity of their own souls. But mostly to smash, though no mortal ever "
"could. To set free, even onto death, these criminals, these unfortunate, "
"these living beings, who once loved and hoped and wished quietly under "
"the sky for peace within their hearts. You must keep moving. There is a "
"madness here as alive with intent as a snake beneath the water.",
         12: "To the East was The Spine; a crooked ridge that twisted in "
"gradual descent from A Vumu to Estill, Northernmost point of the "
"Eastern hillocks. North, A Vumu melted into The Smile. West lay the "
"terrible beauty of the soul shards. South lay more forest.",
         13: "The Northern sweep of cliffs climbs up out of the waters "
"shadowing black volcanic rock, sheer and deadly beneath. Grasses become "
"stubbled, then sparse, then barely a green or brown shoot to be seen, the "
"further South one peered. East the same slow drying of the land could be "
"seen as meadow gave way to desert. You could make your way down the West "
"facing rock-face that led down to the beach, it was a short wall of "
"natural black rock. But what good is A Meer if she can't take you to "
"Arturia? That unsettled you. Why had you known the name of this sea? And "
"what sort of nonsense could fill you with such anger at something as "
"impartial as the sea itself?",
         14: "To the North lay the meadow. Mostly flat lands covered by tall "
"wheaten grasses. Patches of bright flowers grew, shaded beneath arching Oaks. "
"To East and West, the modest beauty of the meadow gave way, quickly, to the "
"starkness of the desert. South, sand, heating rising in waves off of it. But "
"the sand seemed restless. It seemed to shift here or there even as you glanced "
"over it.",
         15: "To the North lay the meadow. Mostly flat lands covered by tall "
"wheaten grasses. To the East, the modest beauty of the meadow gave way, quickly, "
"to the stark desert. The Desert stretched beyond your range of vision to the "
"South. Foothills decend from the North here, worn away by wet strong winds off "
"the North sea.",
         16: "Here the The Sorrow becomes The Tears, the narrow waterfall that "
"quenches the forests great thirst. North are the Dragon lands. South, at the bottom "
"of the cliff is the forest. East beyond The Tears, boulders at the cliffs edge. "
"To the west lay the meadow. The rush of The Tears is loud and its mists cool the "
"air but the waterfall is on the other side of the lowest foothill.",
         17: "Here the The Sorrow becomes The Tears, the narrow waterfall that "
"quenches the forests great thirst. North are the Dragon lands. South, at the bottom "
"of the cliff is the forest. East beyond The Tears, boulders line the cliffs edge. "
"To the west are the big rocks buttressing the waterfall.",
         18: "The woods thicken as they sweep up and away from the Southern cliff "
"edge. The Sorrow flows from beneath the soul crystals to the Northwest becoming "
"The Tears at cliffs edge.",
         19: "No shelter could be found from the relentless sun. Even A Meer "
"lapped gently, no winds drove her to shore. Though here and there the sands shifted,"
"restless with the creatures at home here, the horizon was empty. All but for a jagged "
"outcropping of rock to the South.",
         20: "A gnarled cacti. Yet the rest of the world was washed umber. The white hot "
"sun reflected off of the sand making the whole earth shimmer with washed umber. The sky "
"and air glowed in its washed umber reflection. The brightness of it burned onto your eyes "
"so that when you looked up to the sky you saw only washed umber. North, more sand. South, "
"more sand. West, the sea. East, more sand. Sand, sand, sand. "
         21: "To the North, foothills climbed from the earth and marched off to the "
"North. Dead-North, bits of grasses spotted the sand. East of here; sand turned to soil, "
"brush appeared and thickened. And a line of trees spotted the horizon. Everywhere else "
"was sand. Sand on sand, on sand. ",
         22: "Here, the sparse pickings of trees began to thicken toward the Southeast. "
"On the other side of the boulders that marked the bottom of the last hill, The Tears "
"crashed into cleardrink pool, that fed the waters of the forest. Mist filled the air. ",        
         23: "You stood before cleardrink. Cool mist thickened the air and painted "
"rainbows against the sky in every direction. The lively forest, rattled, leaves shook, "
"birds called out and fallen twigs broke beneath a lesser creatures feet." ,
         24: "Birds trilled and chirrupped. The sun scarcely reached the "
"forest floor here. North, the cliff face leading to the Dragon lands. East, the wall "
"of rock decended from the cliff and curved around to the South."                  
         25: "What had seemed a mirage was now clearly a hut. It's walls were of "
"roughly crafted glass, clear and as deep as the length of your arm and therefore "
"opaque. You made out what could be a table and in the opposite corner the flicker "
"of a fatted wick. Though the light indicated a presence nothing within looked to "
"be the shape of a . . . wait! Something had moved ever so slightly. There, hunched "
"over an oversized table a figure was hard at work on something. Might they mind an "
"interrupption? Might they mind it enough to use whatever fantastic weapons a so terribly "
"talented glasssmith could produce?",
         26: "To the West, Northerly and Southerly, great dark shards of shimmering black "
"reached into the horizon, jagged at the tips. Directly West lay the path between them. ",
         27: "Dense forest to the East, the edge of which trails Southeast. Desert South, "
"North and West.",
         28: "Surrounded by dense forest, you stood upon an immense boulder. It allowed you "
"to spy the Western Desert, the Northern Volcano and the Northwest meadows. A well trodden "
"path led East. The faint sounds of hammering and shouting seemed to come from that direction. ",
         29: "Felled trees, the height and width of legendary giants, stretched from the natural "
"outcroppings of boulders that the town sheltered within to an opening, near which had been carved "
"the towns' name, \"Garzhed\". The path, which wound through dense forest, out in all directions "
"looked well-used. ",
         30: "The Marketplace was lively. Barmaids shouted at patrons, shoved boots from bench "
"tables and delivers frothy mugs. The intoxicated created a clamor. Those on drink sang in small groups in front of "
"a minstrel near the entrance and a musician near the back curve of the cul-de-sac. Those on vapors "
"lounged beside the rocky pool, that deliverd The Tears sweet waters to the town or sat, or sat and "
"and watched the wood-carver create life from felled life, pulling from their pipes, hat brims pulled "
"forward to block the sunlight that poured into the towns center. Sweet smells from rolls of the bakery, "
"from candy of the confectionaire, from jams and jellies of the wives at the stalls, mixed with the "
"deep savory scents of roasting meats of street-side pits and herb encrusted fish blackening on iron ".
"Less enticing scents met you most of all though. The strong smell of soil that permeats the deep forest "
"greeted you foremost of course. But the smell of sweat and waste, horse manure and livestock in their "
"stalls, meat drying slowly in the sun; caked in salt hung strong. Two larger shops stood among the stalls "
"nearer the entrance, the blacksmith; a stone trough on the left. A rack of finished polearms stood, "
"center of the shop. It obscured the work area in the back. From whence came the deafening thunder of "
"metal striking hot metal. In the near-dark of the open front, covered room, the sparks betrayed the "
"location of the blacksmiths. Further into town, in the curve of the cul-de-sac, the other large shop "
"was some sort of apothecary. dried herbs hung from the rafters out front. Within, you see someone "
"working at something behind a wooden counter that stretches the width of the shop. "
         31: "Hills of green and mustard-yellow glass-shards walled you in. The wall of shards stretched "
"out in a line to the North. In the West it curved down to the South where it curved again, headed "
"East.",
         32: "Shards of glass, twice the height of a house, walled off the South. To the Northwest there "
"appeared to be a break in the wall of shards. Everywhere else stood unrelenting desert. ",
         33: "The desert here trails into light woods that become dense not far off. The Southern wall of "
"shards ends somewhere beyond the treeline to the East. Due North the fade of forest into desert stretches. ",
         34: "The forest is thick and alive with wood peckers thumping, animals shaking the brush, the creaking "
"of crickets and the grunting of wild boars. North a boulder can be seen, stretching higher than the horizon. "
"To the east, the path leads further into the forest. To the South a thick wall of trees blocks further passage. "
"To the West the path leads from the forest into the woods. ",
         35: "A well-trodden path led through the forest in three directions. West, North and East. To the "
"South a dense line of trees blocked the path. ",
         36: "Over the natural wall of boulders to the North you noticed many separate plumes of smoke. You "
"heard metal being struck, also, sawing, shouting and laughing; a lute at one end of the wall and song, joined-in "
"by a bawdry group, from a fair-voiced minstrel; all the bustle of a town. East and South, dense trees form a "
"barricade. "
