scene = {1: "The meadow breaks and drops to North and West, ringed and "
"buttressed by the jagged black rock drop into the sea. Here, where the "
"sea spray travels the winds and falls upon the grasses, no trees take "
"root. Only wheaten grasses grow in abundance, they sway under the gales "
"in ripples that make the North-West meadow seem a sea of its own.",
         2: "Clouds seldom trouble the skies so near to the meadows "
"farthest edge. Hundreds of feet above the crashing sea, this stretch of "
"land is clear of trees and home to crab grass and wild rose bushes."         ,
         3: "A fog hangs over the line of foothills that run from North "
"to South. Prairie grass and wildflowers give way to thickening brush "
"and a scattering of willows with arms outreached. "         ,
         4: "The Western range of summits, passable, unlike it's Eastern "
"echo, stretched from Southwest to Northwest. It ended at the point "
"between the Eastern and Western summits known as The Dragons Smile. The "
"Smile: three crooked lines of jagged rock outcropping that the cruel "
"and ceaseless winds had filed into spear-like points. If the warm blue "
"sky brought hope to this place, The Smile tore it apart and consumed it "
"with delight.",
         5: "The waters of The Sorrow were icy as befitting its surroundings. "
"To the North, a dozen round openings in the three rows of jagged rock. The "
"caves had been crudley smashed into the rockface. Their entrances are all "
"obscured by char.To the East rose the volcano, A Vumu. To the South, water "
"trickled through the Soul Shards.",
         6: "A towering volcano churns. Spewing acidic fog out over "
"itself. Twisted, grey trees spot the middle of the volcano and the "
"base is thick with thorned brush and alive with the hissing of the "
"volcano lizards that thrived in the shadow of the sulfuric chimney "
"that kept a steady stream of avian meat falling their way.",
         7: "A strip of wind-swept meadow runs from South to North. "
"To your West this drops abruptly into the ocean. To the East is the "
"back of a hut-like dwelling. Vines cover the sunburned walls. The "
"plaster has fallen away in places to reveal cerulean blue brick. "
"Ivy covers the back wall. Through the window you hear humming. The "
"tune sounds faintly familiar. "         ,
         8: "The inside of her home is open and airy. Sunlight pours "
"through the windows. Vines hang outside the windows, heavy with bloom, "
"the rich sugar and lemon scent of which had soaked into the the faded "
"brown rough-spun wool covered seats and bed. In the back right corner "
"a black kettle half the size of a horse sat on an iron stand in the "
"open stove. The Stove itself comprised the corner where that joined the "
"Western and Northern walls. All of the shimmering black cliff rock that "         ,
         9: "A fog hangs over the line of foothills that run from North "
"to South. Prairie grass and wildflowers give way to thickening brush "
"and a scattering of willows with arms outreached.",
         10: "The Western summits flanked your left. Sun browned, "
"speckled with common yellow and blue-bell wildflowers and alive at "
"the thicket with birds that shook leaf cluster as they hopped from "
"one branch to another. Snakes bent the tall dry grasses, toads and "
"water fowl made wary gutterations as they worked to silence the "
"clicking, clacking, humming and buzzing of a host of insects around "
"them. To your right you heard the waters of The Sorrow breaking around "
"the crystal columns that encased the bodies and souls suspended there. " 
"Including Arturia. The sun struck the crystals. Within, light and "
"energy deposed each other fervently. All movement leads to creation. "
"There was movement in each of these and between them an elegant dance, "
"The sun, the memory and structure of the crystal, the malleability and "
"powers of transference of the water and the minerals leached from the "
"soil. Thick as syrup, a wheaten gold, from beneath the clustered "
"crystals flowed. Once around the crystals roots to warmer waters and "
"back down again, backwashed to empty into The Sorrow while the winters "
"snow pack melted steadily. The waters came to calm within the vast lake, "
"over its brow the join of Eastern and Western Summits known as The "
"Dragons Smile. Here in the bottom of The Sorrow that souls honey "
"hardened into common gold.",

	     all at once to weep, to fall to your knees in thanks to the 
	     gods that so small a soul could, in life, relieve you eyes
	     with such beauty, to scream at the impossiblity of life at
